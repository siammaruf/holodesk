## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Server

```bash
# Update system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Node.js (if not installed)
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs

# Install PostgreSQL (if not installed)
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib

# Install PM2 globally
npm install -g pm2
```

### Step 2: Clone Repository

```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd nestjs-starter-kit

# Checkout production branch (if applicable)
git checkout main
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with production values
nano .env

# Set MODE=PROD
```

### Step 4: Install and Build

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install --production

# Build the application
npm run build
```

### Step 5: Run Database Migrations

```bash
# Run migrations
npm run migration:run
```

### Step 6: Start Application

```bash
# Start with PM2
pm2 start dist/main.js --name "nestjs-app"

# Save PM2 configuration
pm2 save

# Setup auto-restart on server reboot
pm2 startup

# Check status
pm2 status
```

### Step 7: Configure Nginx (Reverse Proxy)

```nginx
# /etc/nginx/sites-available/nestjs-app
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:4000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

```bash
# Enable site
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/nestjs-app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

# Test configuration
sudo nginx -t

# Restart nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Step 8: Setup SSL with Let's Encrypt

```bash
# Install Certbot
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx

# Obtain certificate
sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com

# Test auto-renewal
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

### Step 9: Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check application is running
pm2 status

# View logs
pm2 logs nestjs-app

# Test endpoints
curl https://your-domain.com
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
```

---

## 🔄 Post-Deployment

### Monitor Application

```bash
# View real-time logs
pm2 logs nestjs-app

# Monitor CPU and memory
pm2 monit

# Check error logs
tail -f logs/error.log
```

### Common PM2 Commands

```bash
# Restart application
pm2 restart nestjs-app

# Stop application
pm2 stop nestjs-app

# View detailed info
pm2 info nestjs-app

# Clear logs
pm2 flush
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start

1. Check environment variables: `cat .env`
2. Check logs: `pm2 logs nestjs-app` or `cat logs/error.log`
3. Test database connection: `psql -h <host> -U <user> -d <database>`
4. Verify build: `ls dist/`

### Database Connection Issues

1. Check PostgreSQL is running: `sudo systemctl status postgresql`
2. Verify credentials in `.env`
3. Check firewall rules: `sudo ufw status`
4. Test connection manually: `psql -h localhost -U postgres`

### 502 Bad Gateway (Nginx)

1. Check application is running: `pm2 status`
2. Check port in nginx config matches app port
3. Check nginx error log: `sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log`

## 🔙 Rollback Procedure

If deployment fails:

```bash
# Stop current version
pm2 stop nestjs-app

# Checkout previous version
git checkout <previous-commit-or-tag>

# Rebuild
npm install
npm run build

# Restart
pm2 restart nestjs-app

# Rollback database (if needed)
npm run migration:revert
```
